# WelfareManipulation
Supporting code for the paper "Welfare effects of strategic voting under scoring rules"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10897)

## I want to see the results
The notebook "Results_Interface_with_pictures.ipynb" visualises all the studied scenarios (and many more). Open locally or in Colab, as is convenient. If your browser/editor complains about loading 50mb of plots, "Results_Interface_no_pictures.ipynb" contains the code but not the output. The data used is in the file "results.zip". To use with the notebook, unzip into a folder and upload to Colab or Google Drive, or if using locally modify the path to the data in the first cell of the notebook to point to where you keep the results.

## I want to check your code/generate new data
The results were generated by the Visual Studio solution WelfareManipulation.

The main class is Program.cs. There you can modify the parameters of the simulations by uncommenting/commenting the parameters as described in the main file.

UnitTestProject1 contains the unit tests for the solution. If they stop passing, something is wrong.
