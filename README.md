# WelfareManipulation
Supporting code for the paper "Welfare effects of strategic voting under scoring rules"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10897)

## I want to see the results
The notebook "Results_Interface.ipynb" visualises all the studied scenarios. Open locally or in Colab, as is convenient. The data used is in the file "results.zip". To use with the notebook, upload to Colab or Google Drive, or if using locally modify the path to the data in the first cell of the notebook accordingly.

## I want to check your code/generate new data
The results were generated by the Visual Studio solution WelfareManipulation.

The main class is Program.cs. There you can modify the parameters of the simulations by uncommenting/commenting the parameters as described in the main file.

UnitTestProject1 contains the unit tests for the solution. If they stop passing, something is wrong.
